## Abstract

This chapter aims to briefly introduce the fundamentals for deep learning, which is the key component of deep reinforcement learning. We will start with a naive single-layer network and gradually progress to much more complex but powerful architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We will end this chapter with a couple of examples that demonstrate how to implement deep learning models in practice.

**Keywords**: deep learning, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks
