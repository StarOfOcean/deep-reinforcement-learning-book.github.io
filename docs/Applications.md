## Content
To help the readers deeply understand DRL and quickly apply those widely used techniques in practice, the following chapters introduce five selected applications or large-scale projects, including the learning to run challenge, image enhancement, AlphaZero, robot learning in simulation, and multi-agent reinforcement learning with Arena platform. The applications are selected to cover as much usage as pos- sible, for helping the readers to understand the details and tricks of implementation in different scenarios.

The related codes with environment supports and algorithm implementations
are released in the following link: [https://github.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-book](https://github.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-book).
