## Abstract

In this chapter, reinforcement learning is analyzed from the perspective of learning and planning. We initially introduce the concepts of model and model-based methods, with the highlight of advantages on model planning. In order to include the benefits of both model-based and model-free methods, we present the integration architecture combining learning and planning, with detailed illustration on Dyna-Q algorithm. Finally, for the integration of learning and planning, the simulation-based search applications are analyzed.

**Keywords**: model-based, model-free, Dyna, Monte-Carlo Tree Search, Temperal Difference (TD) search
