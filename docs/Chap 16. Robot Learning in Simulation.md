## Abstract

This chapter introduces a hands-on project for robot learning in simulation, including the process of setting up a task with a robot arm for objects grasping in CoppeliaSim and the deep reinforcement learning solution with soft actor-critic algorithm. The effects of different reward functions are also shown in the experimental sections, which testifies the importance of auxiliary dense rewards for solving a hard-to-explore task like the robot grasping ones. 
Brief discussions on robot learning applications, sim-to-real transfer, other robot learning projects and simulators are also provided at the end of this chapter.
