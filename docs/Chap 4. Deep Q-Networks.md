## Abstract

This chapter aims to introduce one of the most important deep reinforcement learning algorithms, called deep Q-networks. We will start with the Q-learning algorithm via temporal difference learning, and introduce the deep Q-networks algorithm and its variants. We will end this chapter with code examples and experimental comparison of deep Q-networks and its variants in practice.

**Keywords**: temporal difference learning, DQN, double DQN, dueling DQN, prioritized experience replay, distributional reinforcement learning
